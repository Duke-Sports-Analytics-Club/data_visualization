This is the 3rd installment of Duke Sports Analytics Mini Course in R.
In this workshop, we are going to be doing a deep dive into data visualization. 

Communicating your results to an audience is essential to a data scientist!

## Data

We're going to be using the `gamezoneR` men's college basketball R package. Yes, I am the author of this package and I will shamelessly plug its use.

## Working with dplyr

`dplyr` is a key data wrangling package that we will use and apply in the tutorial.

Highly recommend reading from the [official website](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/dplyr.html ) to get a clearer picture of how each function works.

## Working with ggplot2

`ggplot2` is a brilliant plotting package in R. 'gg' stands for 'grammar of graphics'. We will make our visualizations using this package. Learn more about ggplot2 [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/index.html)

## Resources

Want to further your understanding of some of the functions used in the
analysis? Check out the resources folder of the repository. 

Want to learn on your own? See this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fWET_GreI5qO2E-DDDojsmlfNeoQgZaCji-4D5M3PmA/edit#) for a recommended learning pathway. 

The below books are also great resources. R Cookbook is for beginners, while
R for Data Science does require some basic knowledge of R.
